Project Motivation: 
We aim to use the Summer Olympic Medals dataset to analyze and classify athletes' performances. We will develop a predictive model to estimate their likelihood of winning Gold, Silver, Bronze medals, or not winning at all. This project enhances athletic performance and supports the understanding of factors influencing success.
