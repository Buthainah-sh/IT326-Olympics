    "## Goal:\n",
    "In this project, our primary goal is to use the Summer Olympic Medals dataset to cluster and classify athletes' performances in terms of medals won. We aim to develop a predictive model that forecasts the likelihood of an athlete winning a Gold, Silver, Bronze, or no medal based on factors such as team, country, sport, and their previous medal history.\n",
